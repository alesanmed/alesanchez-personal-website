                                That project was about developing video games for children with cerebral palsy. The
                                game was developed using XNA and a Kinect device, used for controlling the character
                                in-game. The games were mainly question and answer games and the kid had to make some
                                movement with the head, or just say anything in order to select the correct answer.

                                This internship gave me my first contact developing "more realistic" software than just
                                the projects made as part of the Bacherlor's Degree. I learned about C# and Kinect
                                development. But the main thing I learned during this internship was that computer
                                sciences and software engineering can be used for improving people's live in many ways.

                                I learned a lot about the startups creation and development process. I had to take an
                                idea and build something profitable from it. That process made me change the idea,
                                solve problems, interview people and fail again and again until I built something
                                useful.

                                better software engineer years later. I acquired a wide set of skills, not only
                                programming skills but teamwork skills, public speaking skills, project management,
                                customer development... But the most important thing for me is that I learnt how to
                                solve problems. I learnt how to confront new problems in creative ways or by learning
                                new techniques or acquiring new skills to solve that problem.

                                My Final Degree Project was an evolutionary algorithm to analyse genes involved in
                                cancer. It was in collaboration with a biology student, thus I learned how to work with
                                people from different fields. With this project I realized that I wanted to use my
                                education in Computer Sciences for helping others.</p>
